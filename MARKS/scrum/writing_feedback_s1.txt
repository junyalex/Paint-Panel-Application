S&O: 1
WM: 2
AE: 1.5

Feedback:
- [S&O] Architecture file has little writing added on top of the base file.
Some of the user stories need more detail such as making sure estimate and actual are noted (ensure consistency with other user stories/bugs).

- [WM] Watch for sentence complexity and/or sentence clarity like in line 42 of the architecture under the observer pattern. 
Also make sure to have same/words written consistently. Lastly, watch out for typos like "PainPanel" under #1 of architecture.
Some pronouns are not consistent in the SO THAT; some use 'I' while some refer to 'the user'. Please find them all and fix them

- [AE] The level of detail provided is not appropriate enough for a new team member to understand your project status. Make sure details user story and bugs are polished/consistent.
The shift in perspective is also an AE issue when it switches from first to third person. "I WANT  : Before a user creates an object..." is inappropriate for the genre.
