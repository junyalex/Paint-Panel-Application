New Drawing Mode: Drawing shapes
Description:

	Shape buttons are displayed on the left side of the canvas. Users can pick the shape
	they would like to draw by clicking on one of the shape buttons.

	When users click shape button, it selects the mode and a strategy for handling
	user input for drawing mode is installed.

	PaintPanel class handles 3 types of mouse events. Pressed, Dragged and Released.
	When users trigger mouse events, with selected strategy, it draws the shape on the canvas
	users can see it. By using observer pattern, whenever there is a modification to the
	PaintModel (Observable), it notifies to PaintPanel (Observer) that there was a modification
	to the model, PaintPanel updates itself and users can see the changes they have made which means
	they can see the shape they have drawn through the screen.

Implementation:

	image icon: Image icons are displayed by Strings that users can recognize. Buttons that show
	different types of shape are added to ShapeChooserPanel.

	Draw Strategy : Since different types of drawing technique is required for each shape,
	Strategy pattern is used. Each shape has their own DrawStrategies when User chooses a shape,
	it calls setMode() method in PaintPanel class. In setMode() method, it uses ShapeFactory class
	which creates concrete classes of DrawStrategy class to create proper object of Strategy.
	Once Strategy object is created, users can draw shapes by 3 steps.

	1 : Once mouse is pressed, it creates new Shape object.

	2 : While users are dragging, in order to let them see the current status of shape so users can
	    see how it is being drawn, shape will be added to PreviewShapes, which is an ArrayList.

	3. When mouse is released, it adds to Shapes ArrayList, and shapes created while dragging
	   gets deleted.

Example: for drawing circle :
    PaintModel.java, PaintPanel.java, DrawStrategy.java, RectangleDrawStrategy.java, ShapeFactory.java
    SelectMode.java
